## Overview

The lifetime of a Casper account is as follows:

1. A private/public key-pair is generated by a user's wallet application.

2. The public key is used as the target for transferring X CSPR tokens to the account. 

3. The Casper system will detect that the account is new and will: 

- create a new on-chain account;

- initialise the on-chain account's main purse with X CSPR tokens;

The user's public key is mapped to a unique identifier known as the **Account Hash**.  This identifier is used to query the chain for account information.

## JSON-RPC

The JSON-RPC API exposes the **state_get_item** endpoint - it can be sued to retrieve on-chain account information.  It accepts the following parameters:

**key**

- the account hash, e.g. account-hash-21e8cee83ced9ff174357dc5d9b797f259994354993f01e18db49cda2a7700b3;

**state_root_hash**

- the state of the blockchain's database at which the node will perform a balance query;

## NOTES

- a user's public key can be mapped to an account hash using a supported Casper SDK.
